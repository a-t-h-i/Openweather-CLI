# Openweather-CLI
Just a simple weather program made with Python, it gets the latest weather data for any given city on Earth (sorry aliens, Earth only :P).

You'll need an API key from Openweather in order to use it, you can get the code from here: https://openweathermap.org/

First clone the project: `git@github.com:a-t-h-i/Openweather-CLI.git`

Then cd to the cloned project by running: `cd Openweather-CLI`

Run this command to setup a virtual environment and activate it: `python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate`

Now install the requirements using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally you get to run this masterpiece (JK  >_<) using this command: `python3 main.py`
