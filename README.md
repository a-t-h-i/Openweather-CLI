# Openweather-CLI
Just a very simple weather program made with Python, the program makes use of the openweather api to get the lates weather data for any given city on earth (Sorry aliens, earth only :P).

First clone the project: `git@github.com:a-t-h-i/Openweather-CLI.git`

Then cd to the cloned project by running: `cd Openweather-CLI`

Run this code to setup a virtual environment and activate it: `python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate`

Now install them requirements using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally you get to run this masterpiece (JK  >_<): `python3 main.py`
